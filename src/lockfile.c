/* lockfile.c
 *
 * Creates a lock file for the Sagan process.    We don't want Sagan to be
 * running more than once.  Also does a simple 'test' to see if the PID
 * in the lock file is 'running' (via kill -0).   Wrote this to decrease
 * the dependancies of Sagan,  as opposed to using liblockfile.
