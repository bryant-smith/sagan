/* event-id.c
 *
 * This work in conjunction with the "event_id" rule option.
 *
 * This searches for a event id based off the type of data it has received.  Think
 * of Microsoft Windows logs that have "event id". However,  this function is not
 * restricted to Microsoft logs! If the event ID has already been parsed via
 * JSON or liblognorm,  that value is used.  If the log has no "parsed" values,
 * we treat it like a traditional Windows logs.  Most programs (NXlog, Evtsys, etc),
 * place the event ID at the front of the log line.  For example.
 *
 * 1234: log message here
 *
 * In that case,  we do the equivalant the following:
 *
 * content: " 1234|3a| "; offset: 0; depth: 8;
 *
 * Event ID's are stored as "strings".  This allows for greater flexibility with
 * event IDs.  For example,  0001234 doesn't get translated to 1234.
